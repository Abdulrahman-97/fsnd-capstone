# FSND Capstone Project  
This is the final project in the Full Stack Nanodegree. It will be an application of all concepts learned throughout this course. For this project, a Casting Agency API will be implemented

    - GET /actors and /movies
    - DELETE /actors/ and /movies/
    - POST /actors and /movies and
    - PATCH /actors/ and /movies/
&nbsp;
- Roles:
    - Casting Director
        - Can view actors and movies
        - Add or delete an actor from the database
        - Modify actors or movies
    - Executive Producer
        - All permissions a Casting Director has andâ€¦
        - Add or delete a movie from the database

## Getting Started
------------------
### Prerequisites
- Python3
- PIP

### Running The Server Locally
---------
**Virtual Environment**
- Create a Virtual Environment in backend directory
```bash
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```
- Activate venv
```bash
$ source <venv>/bin/activate
```
> [Creation and Activation of virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

**PIP Dependencies**

Now you have your venv created and activated, run the following command to install all required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Database Setup**
- Create capstone database, and restore the database provided 
```bash
dropdb capstone
createdb capstone
psql capstone < capstone.psql
```

**Running the server**
```bash
source setup.sh
flask run
```

### Testing
------
To run the tests, run the following:
```bash
dropdb capstone_test
createdb capstone_test
psql capstone_test < capstone.psql
python test_app.py
```

## API Reference
------------
### Getting Started
- Base URL: The backend app is hosted at [https://as-capstone.herokuapp.com/](https://as-capstone.herokuapp.com/) or   
you can run it locally at ```127.0.0.1:5000```
- Authentication: Tokens can be found in the setup.sh file.
### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects as shown below:
```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 404,
    "message": "resource not found!"
}
```

The API will return one of the following error types when a request fails:
- 404: Not Found

- 405: Method Not Allowed
